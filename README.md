# 👋 Hi, I’m James (@capjamesg)

I am a technical marketer at [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com).

I blog about the web, coffee, and more at [jamesg.blog](https://jamesg.blog).

I maintain a calm web reader called [Artemis](https://artemis.jamesg.blog). It's free for all to use.

I authored a book on technical writing: [Software Technical Writing: A Guidebook](https://jamesg.blog/book.pdf).

I am building a programming language for analyzing knowledge graphs called [Knowledge Graph Language (KGL)](https://github.com/capjamesg/knowledge-graph-language), and previously built a programming language for computer vision called [VisionScript](https://github.com/capjamesg/visionscript).

Professionally, I maintain [Autodistill](https://github.com/roboflow/autodistill) and its model connectors. I contribute to [supervision](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision), [notebooks](https://github.com/roboflow/notebooks), and other open source computer vision projects.

My personal website is made with [Aurora](https://github.com/capjamesg/aurora). My website search engine is powered by [JameSQL](https://github.com/capjamesg/jamesql).
