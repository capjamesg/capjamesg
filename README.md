# Hi, I’m James (@capjamesg)

I blog about the web, coffee, and more at [jamesg.blog](https://jamesg.blog).

I maintain a calm web reader called [Artemis](https://artemis.jamesg.blog). It's free for all to use.

I authored a book on technical writing: [Software Technical Writing: A Guidebook](https://jamesg.blog/book.pdf).
