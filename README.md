# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m James (@capjamesg)

I am a technical marketer at [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com), where I work to make computer vision more approachable and demonstrate the ways in which computer vision can solve different problems.

I blog about programming, coffee, the web, writing, and more at [jamesg.blog](https://jamesg.blog).

I authored a book on technical writing: [Software Technical Writing: A Guidebook](https://jamesg.blog/book.pdf).

I am building a programming language for analyzing knowledge graphs called [Knowledge Graph Language (KGL)](https://github.com/capjamesg/knowledge-graph-language) and another for computer vision called [VisionScript](https://github.com/capjamesg/visionscript). I maintain [Autodistill](https://github.com/roboflow/autodistill). I contribute to [supervision](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision), [notebooks](https://github.com/roboflow/notebooks), and other open source computer vision projects.

I am a co-chair on the [W3C Social Web Incubator Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/socialcg/), working to advance social web standards.
